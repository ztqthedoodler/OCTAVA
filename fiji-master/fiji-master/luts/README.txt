starting with an upper case letter are from the WCIF distribution
of ImageJ by Tony Collins. The others were distributed with the
NCSA PalEdit program or with NIH Image. Known exceptions:

   1. LUTs prefixed by "mpl-": Matplotlib colormaps created by NJ
      Smith, S van der Walt, and (in the case of viridis) E Firing,
      under a CC0 license (http://bids.github.io/colormap/)
   2. glasbey LUTs (http://imagej.net/Glasbey), based on Glasbey et
